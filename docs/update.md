Updates will be announced on the [bqworks](https://twitter.com/bqworks) Twitter channel, so I recommend following in order to be up to date with the latest releases. Also, updates will be announced in the Changelog section of the accordion's CodeCanyon page.

When a new version is available, you can download it for free from your CodeCanyon account: [http://codecanyon.net/downloads/](http://codecanyon.net/downloads/).
